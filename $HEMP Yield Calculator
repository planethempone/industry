The Sovereign’s Harvest: $HEMP Yield Calculator

To empower our Cultivators and Sovereigns, we have developed a specialized logic for the Planet Hemp Calculator Tool. This tool does not just measure weight; it measures Impact Density, converting physical biomass and atmospheric sequestration into $HEMP$ token estimates.



1. The Core Algorithmic Logic

The calculator operates on the "Triple-Yield Formula." It aggregates three distinct value streams into a single $HEMP$ projection:

$$Total \$HEMP Yield = (Y_{biomass} + Y_{carbon} + Y_{nexus})$$

A. The Biomass Yield ($Y_{biomass}$)

Calculated based on the dry weight of the stalks (fiber + hurd).
Standard Rate: 10 $HEMP$ per Metric Ton (MT) of dry biomass.
Variable: Acreage $\times$ Regional Yield Factor (Average: 2.5–4 MT/acre).

B. The Carbon Sequestration Yield ($Y_{carbon}$)

The "Planet-First" incentive. Based on the $CO_2$ drawdown scientifically verified during the growth cycle.
Standard Rate: 50 $HEMP$ per 1 Metric Ton of $CO_2$ ($tCO_2e$).
Variable: 1.63 tons of $CO_2$ sequestered per 1 ton of hemp stem.
The Root Bonus: An additional 20% is added for carbon sequestered in the soil via the root system and leaf mulch left in situ.

C. The Nexus Multiplier ($Y_{nexus}$)

A bonus for data sovereignty and precision farming.

Bonus: +15% total yield if the farm is equipped with Eco-Guardian sensors.
Bonus: +10% if the crop is part of a verified Permaculture Rotation (Calibration Pillar).



2. The User Interface (Example Calculation)

Input Fields:

Total Acreage: 100 Acres
Cultivar Type: Industrial Fiber (e.g., Futura 75)
Sensor Integration: Yes (Eco-Guardian Connected)
Calibration Level: Year 2 (Rotation Bump: +12%)

Step-by-Step Backend Execution:

Biomass Calculation: 100 Acres $\times$ 3.5 MT/Acre = 350 MT Biomass.
Biomass Yield: 350 MT $\times$ 10 $HEMP$ = 3,500 $HEMP$.
Carbon Calculation: 350 MT $\times$ 1.63 ($CO_2$ conversion) $\times$ 1.2 (Root Bonus) = 684.6 $tCO_2e$.
Carbon Yield: 684.6 $\times$ 50 $HEMP$ = 34,230 $HEMP$.
Nexus Calibration: (3,500 + 34,230) $\times$ 0.25 (Total Multiplier: 15% sensor + 10% rotation).
Nexus Bonus: 9,432.5 $HEMP$.

Total Projected Yield: 47,162.5 $HEMP$



3. The "Resilience" Stress Test

The calculator includes a "Weather & Market Slider" to help Sovereigns prepare for volatility:
Drought/Flood Simulation: Reduces biomass yield by 20–40% but increases the "Resilience Fund" payout eligibility.
Market Surge: Increases the value of $HEMP$ vs. $CO2e$ credits based on current Green Renaissance demand.



4. Visual Dashboard Integration

The results are displayed as a "Hemp Vitality Radar":
Blue Arc: Carbon Power.
Gold Arc: Financial Liquidity.
Green Arc: Ecosystem Health (XP).


"The Calculator is the bridge between the farmer's sweat and the Sovereign's digital weight. It proves that what is good for the soil is inherently good for the ledger."
